# SAP Marketing Function Import Demo

This is a sample java springboot maven project to demo how to call an SAP Marketing function import through a java application.

In this application, I call the /RebuildTargetGroup function import of the API_MKT_TARGET_GROUP_SRV OData API.
Go through the following document for details regarding the same.

You can clone the project and import it into any IDE and run the application on local tomcat.
Or you can also run a maven clean install to generate the jar for the same and can deploy it anywhere to test it.

In order to test the application, make a post call to the /rebuildTargetGroup endpoint with the following details:  

URL:  
{baseURL}/rebuildTargetGroup
 
Request Type:  
POST
 
Header:  
Basic Auth with a valid communication userâ€™s username and password.
 
Body:  
{
                "systemURL":"MarketingSystemURL",  
                "targetGroupUUID":"ValidTargetGroupUUIDPresentInMKTSystem"  
}
